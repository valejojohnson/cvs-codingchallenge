# üõ∞Ô∏è Terraform + AWS ECS/Fargate CI/CD Project

Welcome to the **CVS Coding Challenge Project** ‚Äî a hands-on, fully automated Terraform deployment that builds, pushes, and deploys a containerized Python app to **AWS ECS/Fargate** through a complete **CI/CD pipeline**.

This repo represents a realistic end-to-end DevOps workflow: from infrastructure provisioning to container orchestration, automated testing, and alerting ‚Äî all written in clean, modular Terraform.

---

## üöÄ Quick Start (One Liner)

Clone the repo and deploy:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/valejojohnson/cvs-codingchallenge.git && terraform init && terraform apply
```

## üéØ Task Recap

Here‚Äôs what this project was designed to accomplish:

1. **Deploy a containerized workload via Terraform + CI/CD**
    - ‚úÖ ECS/Fargate cluster deployed using Terraform
    - ‚úÖ Dockerized Python app (`guessing_game_computer.py`) built and pushed via **CodeBuild**
    - ‚úÖ **CodePipeline** automates build and deployment to ECS

2. **Create a secure S3 bucket with Terraform**
    - ‚úÖ Not publicly accessible
    - ‚úÖ Encryption at rest enabled (SSE-S3)
    - ‚úÖ Includes automated Terraform tests under `/tests/s3_bucket.tftest.hcl`

3. **Add a CloudWatch Alarm**
    - ‚úÖ Sends email notifications when a log line is written too frequently (e.g. >10 times/min)
    - ‚úÖ Implemented as a separate **Terraform module** called from the root configuration
    - ‚úÖ Integrated with SNS for alerting

4. **Follow best Terraform practices**
    - ‚úÖ Validations, formatting, and modular file organization
    - ‚úÖ Environment-aware locals and variables
    - ‚úÖ Outputs and IAM roles neatly scoped and reusable

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It All Works

1. **Terraform Provisioning**
    - Runs `terraform init`, `plan`, and `apply` to create all AWS resources:
        - ECS/Fargate Cluster
        - ECR Repository
        - S3 Bucket
        - CloudWatch Alarms
        - IAM Roles and Policies

2. **Continuous Deployment**
    - When you push code, **CodePipeline** triggers **CodeBuild**
    - CodeBuild runs `buildspec.yml` to:
        - Build and tag the Docker image
        - Push it to ECR (`latest` + commit SHA)
        - Generate `imagedefinitions.json` for ECS
    - ECS then automatically deploys the new container with zero downtime

3. **Monitoring and Alerts**
    - **CloudWatch** monitors application logs
    - If a specific log line occurs more than 10 times/minute, an **SNS alert** is sent
